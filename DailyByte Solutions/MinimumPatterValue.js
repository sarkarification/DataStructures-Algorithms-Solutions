// You have been given a pattern consisting of M and N, where M means decreasing, and N means increasing.
// M --- 21
// N ---- 12
// MNM --- 2143 
// MNM can also be 4365 and many moee but we want the smallest possible number so it is 2143.

// Given a pattern, find the smallest number that corresponds to the pattern.
